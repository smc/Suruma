Suruma-3.2.1 is a rehash of earlier releases. The earlier idea of akhand conjuncts for *RA *LA forms is revisited and implemented again with the new opentype specs. The new specs do away with statically-assigned character properties (by the shaping engine) for consonants. Instead, they are font dependent. i.e., post-base forms, below-base forms etc. are all decided by the the font itself. This concept was also used in the initial version of suruma font.

On the design part, the glyphs are redrawn using postscript (cubic) curves with 1000 em size and Ascent: 667, Descent: 333. The minimum recommended size for display use is 16px.

The freedesktop users are better advised to use the auto hint module of the freetype rasterizer rather than using the native hinting methods (interpreting these hinting instructions from the font is also patent encumbered) for better results.

Scope for improvement: plenty, plenty, plenty
